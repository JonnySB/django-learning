## Key Django Features

- Model-Template-View (MTV) Structure
    - ORM - Object-relational Mapper
    - Models
    - URLs and Views
    - Templates
 
<br>

The basic MTV structure is as follows, with python picking up the serverside (back-end) section of the workflow.

Where using python comes into its own is by applying python logic that works in tandem with the mtv structure to bring additional features. E.g. machine learning algos working with the models etc.

### **Additional features not shown in MTV structure above:**
<ul>
    <li>Authentication</li>
    <li>Administration</li>
</ul>

### **Django Drawbacks:**

Django is heavily reliant on idea of a Model; i.e.  a representation of a table in a database. This makes it easy to query data but does mean that you need to understand Models and setting them up for views.
